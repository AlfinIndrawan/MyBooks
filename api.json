    "description": "Sharing Apple Apps With Your Team, Testers & the World You'll learn how to sign up for Apple Developer Program, generate the various certificates needed, configure your app and submit an app to the App Store for approval, both manually and through automated processes through automated pipelines. You'll learn how to use Apple TestFlight to add internal and external testers and receive feedback and crash reports. iOS App Distribution starts with explaining hurdles everyone faces, such as code signing, provisioning profiles, and how to do manual releases. It'll then go into more advanced topics, including distribution through TestFlight, build customization, automation, and continuous integration. Who This Book Is For This book is for beginner to experienced developers who want to know the best and most common workflow to release an app to the App store, as well as limiting frustration by troubleshooting and debugging common issues and problems associated with distributing apps. Topics Covered in iOS App Distribution & Best Practices App Store quick start: Your quickest way from no account to the App Store. Provisioning, code signing & entitlements: In-depth explanation of what they are, why you need them, and how they work. Distribution channels & TestFlight: Learn different ways of distributing your app, within an enterprise, with internal or external testers.

    "description": "Learn how to test iOS Applications! iOS Test-Driven Development introduces you to a broad range of concepts with regard to not only writing an application from scratch with testing in mind, but also applying these concepts to already written applications which have little or no tests written for their functionality. Who This Book Is For This book is for intermediate iOS developers who already know the basics of iOS and Swift development but want to learn how to write code which is both testable and maintainable. Topics Covered in iOS Test-Driven Development The TDD Cycle: Learn the concepts of Test-Driven Development and how to implement these concepts within an iOS application. Test Expressions and Expectations: Learn how to test both synchronous code using expressions and asynchronous code using expectations. Test RESTful Networking: Write tests to verify networking endpoints and the ability to mock the returned results. Test Authentication: Write tests which run against authenticated endpoints. Legacy Problems: Explore the problems legacy applications written without any unit tests or without thought of testing the code. Breaking Dependencies into Modules: Learn how to take dependencies within your code and compartmentalize these into their own modules with their own tests. Refactoring Large Classes: Learn how to refactor large unweilding classes into smaller more manageable and testable classes / objects. One thing you can count on: after reading this book, you'll be prepared to write testable applications which you can have confidence in making changes too with the knowledge your tests will catch breaking changes.",

    "description": "Learn Reactive Programming in Swift with RxSwift!The popularity of reactive programming continues to grow on an every-increasing number of platforms and languages. Rx lets developers easily and quickly build apps with code that can be understood by other Rx developers - even over different platforms.Not only will you learn how to use the RxSwift port to create complex reactive applications on iOS, you'll also see how to easily solve common application design issues by using RxSwift. Finally you'll discover how to exercise full control over the library and leverage the full power of reactive programming in your apps.This books is for iOS developers who already feel comfortable with iOS and Swift, and want to dive deep into development with RxSwift.Topics Covered in RxSwift:- Getting Started: Get an introduction to the reactive programming paradigm, learn the terminology involved and see how to begin using RxSwift in your projects.- Event Management: Learn how to handle asynchronous event sequences via two key concepts in Rx - Observables and Observers.- Being Selective: See how to work with various events using concepts such as filtering, transforming, combining, and time operators.- UI Development: RxSwift makes it easy to work with UI of your apps using RXCocoa, which provides integration of both UIKit and Cocoa.- Intermediate Topics: Level up your RxSwift knowledge with chapters on reactive networking, multi-threading, and error handling.And much, much more!By the end of this book, you'll have hands-on experience solving common issues in a reactive paradigm - and you'l be well on your way to coming up with your own Rx patterns and solutions!",

    "description": "Fearlessly change the design of your iOS code with solid unit tests. Use Xcode's built-in test framework XCTest and Swift to get rapid feedback on all your code - including legacy code. Learn the tricks and techniques of testing all iOS code, especially view controllers (UIViewControllers), which are critical to iOS apps. Learn to isolate and replace dependencies in legacy code written without tests. Practice safe refactoring that makes these tests possible, and watch all your changes get verified quickly and automatically. Make even the boldest code changes with complete confidence. Manual code and UI testing get slower the deeper your navigation hierarchy goes. It can take several taps just to reach a particular screen, never mind the actual workflow tests. Automatic unit testing offers such rapid feedback that it can change the rules of development. Bring testing to iOS development, even for legacy code. Use XCTest to write unit tests in Swift for all your code. iOS developers typically reserve unit tests for their model classes alone. But that approach skips most of the code common to iOS apps, especially with UIViewControllers. Learn how to unit test these view controllers to expand your unit testing possibilities. Since good unit tests form the bedrock for safe refactoring, you're empowered to make bold changes. Learn how to avoid the most common mistakes Swift programmers make with the XCTest framework. Use code coverage to find holes in your test suites. Learn how to identify hard dependencies. Reshape the design of your code quickly, with less risk and less fear.",
